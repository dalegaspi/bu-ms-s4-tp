# CS526 Term Project

This is a command-line application that simulates process scheduling using Java's default [`PriorityQueue<E>` implementation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html).  It takes an input file that has the process metadata and logs the output of the simulation to standard output and to a file.  

Full documentation can be found [here](doc/project_documentation.md).
