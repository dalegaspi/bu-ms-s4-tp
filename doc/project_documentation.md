## Overview
## Implementation

### Custom Comparator

### The Data Structure for the Process List

`ProcessList` class extends the Deque<T> generic, but I decided against it for two reasons:

1. There are really just two things done on the list: `peek()` and `remove()` which is part of what a Queue interface does.  No need to expose/define other methods 
2. 

Note that it does, use a Generic Deque internally
